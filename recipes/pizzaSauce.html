   <h2>Why Pizza?</h2>
   <p>The Classic, The Friday Night, The Takeout. When it comes to food types 1 out of every 4 kids will pick pizza. Is that a real statistic? I know that when an item can be called by multiple names that it brings a lot of meaning to that culture. It's suppose to be shared, and that's why it slices.</p>
   <br />
   <p>I think that frozen is fine. Thats about the line that id sit at. I've heard someone has probably passed pizza sauce into their childs blood from how much they have. I was able to work as a pizza maker for some of my life. Picked up the skills to make my own dough and can't go back. Fresh dough pizza is great. We like great things in life, and don't set for fine.</p>
